# Language Translator using Transformer

## Overview

This project aims to create a Language Translator using both a custom Transformer model and a Sequence-to-Sequence RNN model. The custom Transformer model includes a TransformerEncoder, TransformerDecoder, and Positional Embedding, achieving a notable 67% accuracy. Additionally, a Sequence-to-Sequence RNN model, employing GRU units, has been implemented with an accuracy of 64%.

## Transformer Model

### Transformer Encoder

The custom TransformerEncoder is designed to capture contextual information from the input sequences. It effectively processes the input embeddings and passes relevant information to the TransformerDecoder.

### Transformer Decoder

The TransformerDecoder generates output sequences based on the context provided by the TransformerEncoder. It utilizes attention mechanisms to focus on different parts of the input sequences during the decoding process.

### Positional Embedding

To inject word order information into the model, positional embeddings are used. These embeddings help the Transformer model understand the sequential relationship between words in the input sequence.

## Sequence-to-Sequence RNN Model

The Sequence-to-Sequence RNN model utilizes GRU units for its architecture. This model aims to capture sequential dependencies in the input data and generate corresponding output sequences.

## Model Accuracies

- Custom Transformer Model: 67%
- Sequence-to-Sequence RNN Model: 64%

## Improving Accuracy

To enhance the accuracy of the models, consider the following strategies:

### For Transformer Model

1. **Increase Number of Layers**: Experiment with adding more layers to both the encoder and decoder. This can help the model capture more complex patterns in the data.

2. **Adjust Learning Rate**: Fine-tune the learning rate. A lower learning rate can lead to more accurate models, but it may require longer training times.

3. **Fine-tune Positional Embeddings**: Refine the positional embeddings to better capture the nuances of word order in the input sequences.

### For Sequence-to-Sequence RNN Model

1. **Increase GRU Units**: Try increasing the number of GRU units in the RNN layers. This can allow the model to capture more intricate patterns in the sequential data.

2. **Optimize Learning Rate**: Experiment with different learning rates to find the optimal value for your specific dataset.

3. **Explore Attention Mechanisms**: Implement attention mechanisms within the RNN model to allow it to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during the decoding process.
